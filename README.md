The big goal for this project is to have a simulation (e.g. restaurant) where humanoid-like things can interact with each other.
This is an awesome project idea that is feasible because you can use an llm to form the minds of these characters.
So far I've figured out the math behind getting characters to recognise objects within their vision, which I am
considering to be cone shaped. So lots of work left. This project was paused because my GPU broke down. 
I now have a new GPU, so will continue when I get the time.

Developed using Unreal Engine 5
